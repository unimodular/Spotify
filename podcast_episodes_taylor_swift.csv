Reviewing The 2025 Grammy Nominations: This Year’s For The Girls,"In today’s episode, The Snakes critically analyze the 2025 Grammy contenders. It’s been an incredible year of music, particularly for our muse, Taylor Swift, and all of our other favorite pop girls as well. Here, the devil’s advocate is played: each nominee for Album of the Year is presented with their greatest strengths and mortal weaknesses, seeking an objective assessment of who the front runners in this category are. The other ‘big four’ nominations & pop categories are deconstructed elsewhere. One thing is for sure: this year is stacked. From Chappell and Sabrina to Charli, Beyonce, Billie Eilish, and the HBIC, it’s sure to be a night to remember.

2019: Part 1,"The year is 2019. 'Digital fur technology' is a term that has entered our lexicon. There is a suspicious amount of butterfly easter egging.

Then, the world goes dark. Welcome to what is probably the most 'negative' EOAS recap: Taylor Swift's disastrous first six months of her flop era. Reputation's baddie, idgaf, scorched earth queen has disappeared. Instead we have a 30 year old woman who attended cat school for 4 months and wrote SPELLING IS FUN!

2018,"Welcome back to the yearly format. 2018 was an awkward, in-between kind of phase for Taylor Swift and her fandom. It was uncharacteristically quiet for a year of an album cycle: there were some months where she wasn’t pictured at all, and her actual public appearances beyond the Reputation Stadium Tour were few and far between. Nevertheless, we found a lot to say about it. But of course, The Snakes cover the record-breaking tour, the setlist, guest appearances, and outfits. There are a few moments of hilarity: Katy Perry’s literal olive branch, the announcement of Taylor’s starring role as Bombalurina in Cats, and her first foray into activism. It was the year of TaydemoCAT. We end this transitional period with a stormy horizon: a new record deal with Republic and Universal. Enjoy!

Fact-checking The Taylor Swift Origin Story,"Welcome back to another episode of boots-on-the-ground journalism. The bone collector returns to serve a delicious meal: what, exactly, is the Taylor Swift origin story? We know the official narrative: plucky girl meets guitar, moves to Nashville, gets discovered at the Blue Bird Cafe and the rest is history. Was there more to it than that? If the recently resurfaced emails from Scott Swift's 2005 legal dispute with Taylor's former manager are to be taken seriously, then yes. We take an analytical lens to the essential role Taylor's hapless and bumbling, aw-shucks parents played in her rise to stardom & reevaluate her creative partnership with Scott Borchetta along the way too.

2017: Part 2,"PATREON FOR WEEKLY EPISODES: https://www.patreon.com/swiftologist Taylor Swift's reputation era is much lauded as one of her most concise, aesthetically thematic, and sonically jarring eras. To no one's surprise, we concur with this estimation. However, much gets lost in hindsight. Though her career recovered fairly quickly, there were numerous hiccups in the roll-out to reputation that were actually....kind of a big deal. Alt-right sympathizer allegations?! Is the ACLU getting involved? It's a lot. We cover it all, from the conclusion of her trial to the iconic Instagram wipe, Look What You Made Me Do music video, and her brand new approach to being a pop star.
